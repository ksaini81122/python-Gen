    "Q.2 :- What is the difference between for loops and while loops in terms of conditional checks? When would you prefer one over the other? \n",
    "Ans.:- \n",
    "1️ Use Case:\n",
    "– for loop: Used when you know in advance how many times to loop.\n",
    "– while loop: Used when you don’t know how many times to loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "2️ Control Type:\n",
    "– for loop: Iterates over a sequence (like list, string, or range).\n",
    "– while loop: Continues as long as a condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "3️ Typical Syntax:\n",
    "– for loop: for i in range(5):\n",
    "– while loop: while i < 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "4️ Best For:\n",
    "– for loop: Best for a fixed number of iterations.\n",
    "– while loop: Best for indefinite loops or loops based on external events.\n",
    "\n",
    "5️ Condition Checked:\n",
    "– for loop: The condition is automatically handled by the loop.\n",
    "– while loop: You must write the condition explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "6️ Loop Variable Handling:\n",
    "– for loop: Python automatically handles the loop variable.\n",
    "– while loop: You must manually update the loop variable.\n"
